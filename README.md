## New Year for AoC
bin/gen_year.sh will generate empty programs for all days from 1 to 24
for the current year.  If a file already exists in the corresponding
directory it will not be overwritten.

Get the session cookie from the first input, i.e on day 1 request the
input file per mouse click. In the new Firefox tab open More Tools ->
Web Developer Tools. Open Storage in the top tabs, then Cookies. Copy
the session id to the file bin/get.sh.
